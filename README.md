# Minesweeper_Group30_Project
Welcome to our Minesweeper GitHub page! We have all our documents, code, and more housed here. <br>
How does Minesweeper work? In this game, you can select how many bombs you want to place on the board. They will be randomly placed on the board and hidden from the user. The user has to try to click on all the non-bomb cells to win. If they suspect a cell to be a bomb, they can flag it via right-click. As the user clicks on cells, they will get hints to how many bombs are adjacent to that cell they clicked on.
